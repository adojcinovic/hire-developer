My application is written in React.js, and it requires several installations in order to be run on a computer, all of those installations can be run through terminal on mac, or bash app on windows pc. Once you clone repository from github link: https://github.com/adojcinovic/hire-developer.git, you will have to install node package manager or npm on your computer, if using terminal you can run a command npm install -g npm, however there are other ways of installing npm, and guideline can be found here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm. Once you get npm installed, you can navigate to a folder with cloned github repository for my project, and run npm install command, in order to get all required packages that I used to build this project, and this process might take several minutes, depending on how fast your internet download speed is. Once you get this sorted, you can run command npm start, now, browser window shall be opened, with localhost:port as address, and application should be visible and running. To avoid all of this, you can open a link to deployed application on vercel: https://hire-developer.vercel.app/. If you have any questions, I will be available to answer them at any time. Thanks for reviewing my code :)
